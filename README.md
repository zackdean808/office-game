# office-game
This is a quick gtk 3 game using quesitons from the The Office television show. [Tyson N.](https://tynick.com/about/) created the api
I just put a python 3 and gtk 3 wrapper on it. 

There are several variations in the directory structure, text based and python with Gtk. 

What needs to be done: 
- [ ] Wrap main in a loop so that you can keep playing 
- [ ] Fix the sizing issue this way the window doesn't resize everytime you launch it 
- [ ] Generate spec file to build rpm 
- [ ] Create pipeline to auto build
